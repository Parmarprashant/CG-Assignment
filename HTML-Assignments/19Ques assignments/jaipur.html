     <h1>JAIPUR</h1>
    <p>Jaipur, the capital of Rajasthan, is also known as the Pink City of India. It was founded in 1727 by Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II and is famous for its planned layout, rich history, and royal heritage. The city is called the Pink City because many of its buildings in the old town are painted in pink, which symbolizes hospitality.

Jaipur is home to several magnificent forts and palaces, such as the Amber Fort, Nahargarh Fort, Hawa Mahal, and City Palace. These monuments reflect the architectural brilliance of the Rajput rulers. The Jantar Mantar, an astronomical observatory in Jaipur, is even recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

Apart from its monuments, Jaipur is also known for its colorful markets, handicrafts, gems, jewelry, and traditional Rajasthani textiles. Tourists from all over the world visit Jaipur to experience its culture, festivals, and delicious cuisine like dal baati churma and ghewar.
