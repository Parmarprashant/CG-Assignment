    <h1>DELHI</h1>
    <p>Delhi, officially known as the National Capital Territory (NCT) of Delhi, is a vibrant and historic metropolis that serves as the political and cultural heart of India. Straddling the Yamuna River, it seamlessly blends ancient heritage with modern dynamism. The city is divided into Old Delhi, with its bustling bazaars and Mughal-era landmarks like the Red Fort and Jama Masjid, and New Delhi, the meticulously planned capital built during British rule, home to India Gate and the Parliament House. As one of the most populous urban centers in the world, Delhi pulses with energyâ€”its streets alive with diverse languages, cuisines, and traditions. From the grandeur of Lutyens' architecture to the chaos of Chandni Chowk, Delhi is a city of contrasts that captivates every traveler and resident alike.
